Attrition - Yes/No
EmpAttr - Using RandomForest to predict Attrition - Bad specificity and precision (too many false positives)
EmpAttrNoOvertime - Removed instances with overtime - Still too many false positives - no accuracy improvement
EmpAttrC50 - Used C50 package - much better precision, okay accuracy
EmpAttrC50SelectedFeatures - Still using C50 package but with only selected features - no improvement - so we're good with C50
